You're a picaroon, a rogue who relies on your wits and skills to get into and out of trouble.

## Basics

This section details everything you need to know to get playing.

### Hit Dice and Hit Points

You have hit dice (HD) which represent vaguely how lucky and resilient you are. The bigger your HD,
the less likely you are to get yourself killed on your adventures. HD have a die size and count, and
marks. You start play with 1d6 as your HD.

Roll your HD to set your current hit points (HP). Your HP is a counter to how close you are to your
luck running out. For more information about what happens when you hit 0 HP, see
[At 0 HP][1].

### Domains

Domains are free-form and represent an area you've chosen to focus in. They may be skills, topics,
backgrounds, special items, whatever. Domains have a die size, marks, and trick slots. Domains
always start as d6 with 0 marks and 1 trick slot.

Your starting HP determines the number of domains you have:

|     HP      |   1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |   5   |   6   |
| :---------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Domains** |   5   |   4   |   3   |   2   |   1   |   0   |

### Tricks

Each trick slot holds one single trick. Tricks are always specific to their domain. They make the
probable automatic, the unlikely probable, or the impossible possible. Tricks have a die size and
count, marks, and uses per scene. Tricks start at 1d6 with 0 marks and 1 use per scene.

You don't need to fill trick slots for your domains immediately, you may pick or create them later.
For more information, see [Tricks][2].

### Debt

Picaroons start out broke. To take on debt to a patron, faction, or institution, roll 2d6. The lower
result die is the number of domains you get from your guarantor. The higher result die is how many
d6x100 silver of debt you need to clear.

```details { summary="Example: Taking on Debt" }
You've decide to take on debt from Big Tony, who runs a definitely safe and licensed academy for
adventurers, to get a little schooling.

You roll 2d6. The dice show 1 and 4.

You gain one domain. You roll 4d6 and get 11. You owe Big Tony 1100 silver for the privilege of
attending his academy.
```

Picaroons can _always_ seek more debt.

### Tests

When an outcome is uncertain, test by rolling 1d6. On a result of 5 or higher, unless otherwise
stated, you succeed.

When an outcome is contested, all sides test by rolling 1d6. Higher results beat lower results.

If any domains are relevant to the uncertain or contested action, you may roll the die for one of
your relevant domains and take the best result.

### Marks

Whenever you roll your HD, domain die, or trick dice, mark the appropriate section for every die
that shows its maximum (e.g. 6 on a d6, 8 on a d8). You can spend your marks when you rest. For more
information, see [Resting][3].
