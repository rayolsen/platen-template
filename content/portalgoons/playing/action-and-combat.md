  Mechanisms for handling action scenes and combat
---

Action scenes are any points in the game where who's doing what and when matters to the table.
They include chases, fights, infiltrations, etc.

## Taking actions

In an action scene, participants declare up to two actions in order from lowest HD to highest. Where
there are ties, agree who goes first or roll off. Resolve all actions simultaneously as makes
sense.

## Distances

Distances are tracked as zones: adjacent, nearby, distant, and far. Participants can move anywhere
nearby as an action or distant as two actions.

## Attacks

Attacks are always contested. In melee, the highest result is the damage dealt to the participant
with the lowest result. At range, if the shooter's result is lower, they miss.

## At 0 HP

When you drop to 0 HP, choose one immediately:

``````tabs { #WhenDying }

```tab { name="Carry On" }
Transfer your current marks to a loved one. You died, but live on in them.
```

```tab { name="Save Self" }
Test. If successful, you return to 1 HP but are unable to participate for the rest of the scene.
```

```tab { name="Use It" }
Sacrifice 1 HD to get back into it. Reroll your remaining HD. You're back in action with result HP.
```

```tab { name="Wait It Out" }
Roll your HD. Unless someone renders first aid in result rounds, you die.
```
``````

You can spend an action to give first aid to someone else, testing to bring them back to 1 HP. If
rendering first aid after the combat scene ends, no test is required if you have a relevant domain.
