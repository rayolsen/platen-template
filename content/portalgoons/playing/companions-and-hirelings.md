  Secondary characters in Picaroons

You can have as many companions as you have companion slots, if you can convince them to follow you.
Companions are picaroons in their own right.

You can have as many hirelings as you can afford and convince to work with you. Hirelings are
temporary followers who expect at least weekly remuneration. They expect daily remuneration if you
ask them to face danger. This table indicates how they're priced in silver:

| Feature |               Cost               |
| :------ | :------------------------------: |
| HD      |     +1 per die and die step      |
| Domains |         +1 per die step          |
| Tricks  | +1 per die, die step & extra use |

```details { summary="Examples" .info }
If a hireling's HD is 2d6, they expect at least 2s. If their HD is 2d8, 4s.

If a hireling has two domains, one at d6 and one at d10, they expect at least 4s.

If a hireling has a trick at 2d8 they can use 3 times per scene, they expect at least 6s.

A hireling with 2d8 HD, a d6 domain and a d10 domain, and a 2d8 trick with 3 uses per scene expects
at least 14s per week.

## Sample Hirelings
